echo This is a demonstration of a simple justification bug:
echo Soar does not re-apply RHS WM changes when they come
echo from a substate result that would create a duplicate,
echo o-supported justification.
echo 
echo Instructions:
echo >d 9
echo Notice that 'RHS function in add-B-sub' has been printed once,
echo as apply*add-B-sub has fired once.
echo ">matches -w apply*add-B-sub"
echo Notice that apply*add-B-sub is going to fire again, removing
echo S1.attribute A and adding a value of B instead.
echo >step
echo You should see this warning:
echo Ignoring justify5 because it is a duplicate of justify1
echo Notice also that 'RHS function in add-B-sub' has been printed, 
echo so the production definitely fired. However:
echo >p s1
echo Notice that S1.attribute is still A and not B!

# Just Enough Models (JEM)

Your universal model catalog, strong typed, everything, everywhere, all at once.

## Usage

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @moeru-ai/jem
```

Query a model has capabilities:

```typescript
import { hasCapabilities } from '@moeru-ai/jem'

const has = hasCapabilities('openai', 'gpt-4o', ['tool-call'])
```

If you don't know what model you will use, you can use `as` keyword to suppress the type error.

```typescript
import type { Capabilities, ModelNames, ProviderNames } from '@moeru-ai/jem'
import { hasCapabilities } from '@moeru-ai/jem'

const has = hasCapabilities('unknown' as ProviderNames, 'unknown' as ModelNames<ProviderNames>, ['unknown'] as Capabilities<ProviderNames>[])
```

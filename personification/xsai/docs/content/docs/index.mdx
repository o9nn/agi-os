## What is xsAI?

xsAI is a series of utils to help you use OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible API.

## Why use the xsAI?

xsAI has a similar interface to the Vercel AI SDK, but smaller.

This makes it ideal for a variety of scenarios that require smaller bundle size, such as web applications, cli running through npx, and so on.

### So how small is xsAI?

Without further ado, let's look at the results from https://pkg-size.dev:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 20, gzipped: 6.9, installed: 131, name: 'xsai@0.3.3' },
  { bundled: 242, gzipped: 62, installed: 13581, name: 'ai@4.3.19' },
]} />

xsAI reduces the installation size **100x** and the bundle size **12x**.

And it could be smaller!

If you only need basic text generation, you can just install the `@xsai/generate-text` package:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 3.5, gzipped: 1.6, installed: 21, name: '@xsai/generate-text@0.3.3' },
  { bundled: 20, gzipped: 6.9, installed: 131, name: 'xsai@0.3.3' },
]} />

### Why are only OpenAI-compatible API supported?

Considering only OpenAI-compatible APIs keeps us from being plagued by a wide range of compatibility issues while avoiding bloat.

btw, Did you know that [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/openai-sdk), [Google](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) also provides an OpenAI compatible API?

We also support many more providers, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/moeru-ai/xsai/tree/main/packages-ext/providers-cloud/src/providers).

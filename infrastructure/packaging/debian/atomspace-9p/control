Description: AtomSpace hypergraph exposed as 9P file servers
 This package exposes the OpenCog AtomSpace hypergraph database
 as 9P file servers, enabling:
  - Atoms as filesystem directories
  - Truth values as file attributes
  - Links as directory structures
  - Pattern matching as namespace walks
  - Distributed access via 9P protocol
 .
 This makes cognitive operations accessible via standard Unix
 file operations and enables transparent network access.

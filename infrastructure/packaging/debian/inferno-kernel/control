Package: libinferno-kernel1
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Inferno kernel components for AGI-OS
 This package provides the Inferno kernel components including:
  - Dis Virtual Machine (bytecode interpreter)
  - 9P Protocol Stack (distributed file protocol)
  - Limbo Language Runtime
  - Namespace Management Core
  - Cognitive Scheduler
 .
 These components enable cognitive processing as a fundamental
 kernel service in AGI-OS.

Package: libinferno-kernel-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libinferno-kernel1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for Inferno kernel
 This package contains the development files (headers and static
 libraries) for the Inferno kernel components.
 .

Package: inferno-dis-vm
Architecture: any
Depends: libinferno-kernel1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Dis Virtual Machine for Limbo bytecode
 The Dis VM is a bytecode interpreter for the Limbo programming
 language, providing:
  - Type-safe bytecode execution
  - Automatic garbage collection
  - Module loading
  - Cross-platform portability
 .
 This package provides the Dis VM runtime and tools.

Package: inferno-9p-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: libinferno-kernel1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: 9P protocol tools and utilities
 This package provides tools and utilities for working with the
 9P file protocol:
  - 9P server and client implementations
  - File operation utilities
  - Network transparency tools
 .
 The 9P protocol enables distributed file access and is used
 for cognitive operations in AGI-OS.

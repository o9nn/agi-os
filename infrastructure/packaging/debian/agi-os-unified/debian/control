Description: Complete AGI Operating System - unified stack
 This meta-package installs the complete AGI Operating System stack,
 integrating three foundational layers into a unified cognitive computing
 platform. The AGI-OS represents the world's first complete operating
 system designed from the ground up for artificial general intelligence
 research and development.
 .
 The three-layer architecture consists of:
 .
 Layer 1 - Cognumach Microkernel: An enhanced GNU Mach microkernel
 providing advanced memory management, symmetric multiprocessing support,
 and optimized inter-process communication for cognitive workloads.
 .
 Layer 2 - HurdCog Cognitive OS: An OpenCog-powered GNU Hurd system that
 integrates cognitive computing primitives at the operating system level,
 enabling learning, reasoning, and adaptation in system services.
 .
 Layer 3 - OpenCog Collection: A comprehensive AGI research platform
 featuring the AtomSpace hypergraph database, Probabilistic Logic Networks,
 attention allocation mechanisms, pattern mining, language learning, and
 evolutionary optimization.
 .
 This unified system enables cognitive synergy across all layers, where
 the interaction of diverse AI components produces emergent intelligence
 beyond the capabilities of individual parts. The AGI-OS provides a
 complete environment for AGI research, cognitive robotics, natural
 language understanding, knowledge representation, and autonomous systems.
 .
 Key capabilities include distributed hypergraph processing, real-time
 cognitive monitoring, self-optimization, probabilistic reasoning,
 attention-driven resource allocation, and continuous learning from
 experience. The system is built on free software principles and provides
 reproducible builds through GNU Guix integration.

Description: Development tools for AGI Operating System
 This package provides the complete development environment for building
 applications and system components on the AGI Operating System.
 .
 It includes header files, libraries, and tools for developing cognitive
 translators, AtomSpace-aware applications, and system-level components
 that integrate with the three-layer AGI-OS architecture.
 .
 Developers can create applications that leverage cognitive capabilities
 at the microkernel, operating system, and application layers, enabling
 unprecedented integration of AI capabilities into system software.

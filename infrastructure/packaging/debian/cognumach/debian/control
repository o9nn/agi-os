Description: Enhanced GNU Mach microkernel with cognitive features
 Cognumach is an enhanced version of the GNU Mach microkernel, designed to
 serve as the foundation for the HurdCog cognitive operating system and the
 broader AGI-OS stack.
 .
 This microkernel provides advanced features including improved memory
 management, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) enhancements, virtual memory
 optimizations, and modernized PCI support. These enhancements enable
 efficient execution of cognitive computing workloads and support the
 distributed hypergraph processing required by the OpenCog framework.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Advanced memory management with copy-on-write optimization
  - SMP support for parallel cognitive processing
  - Enhanced virtual memory system for large knowledge bases
  - Modernized device driver infrastructure
  - Kernel debugger support for development
  - Message-passing IPC optimized for cognitive agents
 .
 Cognumach serves as Layer 1 in the three-layer AGI-OS architecture,
 providing the foundational primitives upon which HurdCog (Layer 2) and
 the OpenCog Collection (Layer 3) are built.

Description: Development files for Cognumach microkernel
 This package contains the header files and development libraries needed
 to build kernel modules and system servers for the Cognumach microkernel.
 .
 It includes the Mach Interface Generator (MIG) definitions, kernel headers,
 and documentation necessary for developing Hurd translators and other
 system-level components that interact with the microkernel.

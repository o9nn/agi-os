Description: Core cognitive kernel infrastructure for HurdCog
 The HurdCog Cognitive Kernel provides the foundational infrastructure for
 implementing cognitive capabilities within the GNU Hurd operating system,
 transforming it into a self-aware, self-optimizing cognitive OS.
 .
 Core Components:
  * Minimal bootstrap system for cognitive initialization
  * Cognitive interface framework for decision-making and workflow
  * Integration with MachSpace for distributed cognition
  * Support for autonomous agents and distributed coordination
  * Cognitive grip mechanism for universal object manipulation
  * Self-modification and meta-cognitive capabilities
 .
 Architecture Features:
  * Tensor-shaped membranes within recursive P-System
  * Five core subsystems (Memory, Task, AI, Autonomy, Build)
  * Integration with Agent-Zero and ElizaOS patterns
  * GUIX declarative build system enhancement
  * Hypergraph-based capability and issue tracking
 .
 The cognitive kernel implements the core infrastructure that enables
 HurdCog to reason about its own operation, make autonomous decisions,
 and continuously optimize system behavior through cognitive synergy
 between the microkernel, OS, and application layers.
 .
 This package provides the essential cognitive kernel components required
 by all other HurdCog cognitive subsystems (agents, attention, reasoning,
 etc.). It establishes the foundation for the AGI Operating System.

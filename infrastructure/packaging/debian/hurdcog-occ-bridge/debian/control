Description: Integration bridges for OpenCog Collection and HurdCog
 The HurdCog-OCC Bridge provides the critical integration layer that enables
 cognitive synergy between the OpenCog Collection (Layer 2), HurdCog cognitive
 operating system (Layer 1), and Cognumach microkernel (Layer 0).
 .
 Integration Components:
  * AtomSpace-HurdCog Bridge: Python-based bidirectional communication
  * MachSpace Synchronization: Real-time hypergraph sync
  * Cognumach Scheme Interface: Microkernel cognitive primitives
  * HurdCog Scheme Interface: OS-level cognitive operations
  * Unified Integration Framework: Complete three-layer coordination
 .
 Bridge Capabilities:
  * Send and receive atoms between AtomSpace and MachSpace
  * Synchronize cognitive state across all three layers
  * Enable attention-driven resource allocation from ECAN to OS
  * Support learning loops from system behavior to AtomSpace
  * Facilitate cross-layer reasoning with PLN at kernel level
  * Provide cognitive fusion reactor coordination
 .
 The bridge implements the cognitive synergy architecture that allows:
  - Layer 0 (Cognumach) to benefit from cognitive memory management
  - Layer 1 (HurdCog) to leverage distributed hypergraph reasoning
  - Layer 2 (OpenCog) to influence OS and kernel behavior
  - All layers to participate in unified cognitive processes
 .
 This package is essential for enabling the AGI Operating System's
 three-layer cognitive architecture, where intelligence emerges from
 the synergistic interaction of microkernel, OS, and application-level
 cognitive processes.

Description: OS-level AtomSpace integration for HurdCog
 MachSpace provides a distributed hypergraph memory system that extends
 OpenCog's AtomSpace with Mach microkernel-specific features, enabling
 cognitive capabilities at the operating system level.
 .
 Key Features:
  * Distributed hypergraph memory across Mach ports
  * 5-finger cognitive grip mechanism for universal object manipulation
  * Mach IPC integration for cognitive routing
  * Bidirectional synchronization with AtomSpace
  * Integration with Hurd servers and translators
 .
 MachSpace solves GNU Hurd's fundamental problems:
  - Universal grip through AtomSpace integration
  - Identity pointing through unique signatures
  - Coherence strength through PLN validation
  - Trust binding through capability rings
  - Resource tracking through ECAN allocation
 .
 This is the foundational layer that enables HurdCog's cognitive OS
 capabilities, bridging the gap between the Cognumach microkernel and
 the OpenCog Collection's reasoning systems.

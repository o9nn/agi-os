Description: Tensor library for machine learning
 GGML is a lightweight tensor library optimized for machine learning
 inference. It provides efficient CPU-based tensor operations with
 optional GPU acceleration via CUDA, OpenCL, and Metal.
 .
 Features:
  - Optimized CPU tensor operations
  - Quantization support (INT4, INT8, FP16)
  - SIMD acceleration (AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON)
  - Optional CUDA/OpenCL/Metal backends
 .
 This package provides the shared library for GGML.

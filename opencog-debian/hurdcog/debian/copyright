Comment:
 HurdCog combines components from the GNU Hurd project (GPL-2+) with
 OpenCog cognitive computing components (AGPL-3.0+). The Hurd servers
 and translators retain their original GPL-2+ license, while the
 cognitive kernel components use AGPL-3.0+ consistent with OpenCog.
 The dashboard uses GPL-3+ for compatibility with both.

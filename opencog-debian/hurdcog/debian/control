Description: OpenCog-powered GNU Hurd cognitive operating system
 HurdCog is a cognitive operating system built on the GNU Hurd architecture,
 enhanced with OpenCog AGI capabilities. It integrates the Cognumach
 microkernel with cognitive computing primitives to create an operating
 system that can learn, reason, and adapt.
 .
 This package represents Layer 2 of the three-layer AGI-OS architecture,
 sitting between the Cognumach microkernel (Layer 1) and the OpenCog
 Collection AGI framework (Layer 3). HurdCog provides cognitive services
 at the operating system level, enabling distributed reasoning, attention
 allocation, and knowledge management across system processes.
 .
 Key features include:
  - Cognitive Fusion Reactor for multi-paradigm AI integration
  - Master Control Dashboard for real-time system monitoring
  - AtomSpace integration at the OS level (MachSpace)
  - Cognitive-grip abstraction for hypergraph operations
  - Learning and adaptation capabilities in system services
  - Distributed cognitive processing across Hurd translators
  - Integration with Plan 9 and Inferno distributed systems
 .
 HurdCog enables the operating system itself to participate in cognitive
 processes, creating a foundation for truly intelligent system behavior
 and autonomous operation.

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, hurdcog (= ${binary:Version}), libcogutil-dev, opencog-atomspace, cognumach-dev
Description: Development files for HurdCog cognitive OS
 This package contains the header files, libraries, and development tools
 needed to build cognitive translators and system servers for HurdCog.
 .
 It includes the cognitive-grip API, MachSpace integration headers,
 and documentation for developing cognitive system components that
 integrate with the HurdCog operating system.

Package: hurdcog-dashboard
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, hurdcog, python3, python3-flask, python3-websockets
Description: Master Control Dashboard for HurdCog
 This package provides a web-based dashboard for monitoring and controlling
 the HurdCog cognitive operating system. The dashboard offers real-time
 visualization of cognitive processes, attention allocation, knowledge
 graph evolution, and system resource usage.
 .
 Features include:
  - Real-time AtomSpace visualization
  - Cognitive process monitoring
  - Attention allocation heatmaps
  - System performance metrics
  - Interactive query interface
  - Cognitive synergy analysis

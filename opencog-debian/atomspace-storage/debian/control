Description: AtomSpace I/O and StorageNode API for OpenCog
 The atomspace-storage module provides the base StorageNode API for moving
 Atoms into, out of, and between AtomSpaces. This is the foundational I/O
 layer required by all AtomSpace storage backends including RocksDB,
 PostgreSQL, and CogServer network storage.
 .
 The StorageNode API provides a mature, stable, and full-featured interface
 for persistent storage and distributed knowledge representation. It serves
 as the mandatory foundation for:
  - RocksStorageNode (disk-based storage via RocksDB)
  - CogStorageNode (network-distributed AtomSpaces)
  - ProxyNodes (mirroring, routing, caching, filtering)
  - PostgreSQL storage backend
 .
 Key components include:
  - Generic StorageNode API with open, close, load, store primitives
  - CSV/TSV file loading for tabular data
  - File-based Atomese s-expression I/O
  - JSON import/export for web applications
  - MeTTa and Prolog fragment conversion
  - Proxy nodes for complex I/O pipelines
  - S-expression command interface for high-speed network I/O
  - Type lookup table (TLB) for integer ID mapping
 .
 This package is essential for the OpenCog dependency chain and must be
 installed before cogserver, atomspace-rocks, or atomspace-pgres. It
 provides Layer 2.5 functionality in the OpenCog stack, bridging the core
 AtomSpace with all storage and network backends.

Description: Development files for atomspace-storage
 This package contains the header files and development libraries for
 building applications and storage backends that use the StorageNode API.
 .
 Install this package if you need to develop custom storage backends or
 applications that directly use the atomspace-storage API.

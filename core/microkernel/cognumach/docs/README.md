# GNU Mach Architecture Documentation

This documentation set synthesizes the official GNU Mach manual into a practical, systems-architecture-oriented guide, enriched with Mermaid and PlantUML diagrams.

- Audience: kernel and systems engineers, OS researchers, and contributors to GNU Hurd/Mach.
- Sources: Official GNU Mach documentation (see References below).

NanoCog: CogPrime-Aware AI Assistant

A lightweight, GPT-based assistant fine-tuned on CogPrime architecture
and OpenCog implementation details. NanoCog provides:

1. Conversational help with CogPrime theory and OpenCog internals
2. Introspective diagnostics for live CogPrime/OpenCog agents
3. Code generation and refactoring for Atomese/Scheme/MeTTa

The package includes:
- Data preparation tools for training on CogPrime corpus
- FastAPI server for hosting the assistant
- CLI interface for interactive chat and diagnostics
- AtomSpace client for introspective analysis

For more information, see the README.md file.

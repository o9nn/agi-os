# Copilot Rules for Bolt C++ML Project

## Dependency Management Rules

### NEVER use submodules in monorepo
- **Rule**: Do not use git submodules for dependency management in this monorepo
- **Rationale**: Submodules create complexity in monorepos and make dependency management difficult
- **Alternatives**: Use proper dependency management tools like vcpkg or conan instead

### Preferred Dependency Management
1. **Primary**: Use vcpkg with the provided `vcpkg.json` manifest
2. **Alternative**: Use conan with the provided `conanfile.txt` 
3. **System Dependencies**: Only use system package managers (apt, yum, etc.) for base OS libraries

### Implementation Guidelines
- Always update `vcpkg.json` when adding new C++ dependencies
- Use modern CMake `find_package()` with proper targets instead of `pkg_check_modules()`
- Avoid hardcoded include paths and system dependencies
- Keep dependency versions consistent across different package managers

## File Structure Rules
- Dependencies should be managed through package managers, not copied into the repository
- The `ggml/` directory structure is legacy and should be managed through proper dependency management when possible
- Use CMake presets for consistent build configuration across environments
